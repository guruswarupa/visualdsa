    "advantages": [
        "Combines the best features of Quick Sort, Heap Sort, and Insertion Sort, making it efficient for a wide range of input scenarios.",
        "Inherits Quick Sort's average-case performance of O(n log n) while avoiding its worst-case scenario by switching to Heap Sort.",
        "Stable in practice, as it can be implemented to maintain the order of equal elements.",
        "Adaptive: can handle nearly sorted data effectively."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Implementation complexity is higher compared to simpler sorting algorithms.",
        "Requires additional memory for the stack, particularly in recursive implementations.",
        "In practice, may not perform as well as specialized algorithms for specific types of data."
