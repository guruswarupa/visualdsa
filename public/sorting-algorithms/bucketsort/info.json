    "advantages": [
        "Efficient for sorting uniformly distributed data, achieving O(n) time complexity in the best and average cases.",
        "Can handle large datasets well when combined with a good sorting algorithm for individual buckets (e.g., insertion sort).",
        "In-place sorting can be implemented, requiring minimal additional memory.",
        "Stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.",
        "Can be parallelized, improving performance on multi-core systems."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires extra memory for the buckets, which can be significant for large datasets.",
        "Performance heavily depends on the choice of the bucket size and the distribution of the input data.",
        "Not suitable for sorting data with a high variance in value distribution.",
        "The worst-case time complexity can degrade to O(n^2) if all elements fall into a single bucket."
