    "advantages": [
    "Simple to understand and implement.",
    "Does not require any additional memory (in-place sorting).",

    "disadvantages": [
    "Inefficient for large datasets with a time complexity of O(n^2).",
    "Not suitable for large lists due to its poor performance compared to more advanced algorithms like quicksort or mergesort.",
