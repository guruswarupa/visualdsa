    "advantages": [
        "Very simple to understand and implement, making it an excellent educational tool.",
        "Stable sort: maintains the relative order of equal elements.",
        "Can detect whether the array is already sorted, allowing for an early exit in best-case scenarios, leading to O(n) complexity.",
        "In-place sorting algorithm: does not require additional memory."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Inefficient for large datasets with a time complexity of O(n^2) in average and worst cases.",
        "Not suitable for practical applications where performance is a concern.",
        "Requires many comparisons and swaps, leading to poor performance compared to more advanced sorting algorithms.",
        "Performance improves only slightly for nearly sorted data compared to more efficient algorithms."
