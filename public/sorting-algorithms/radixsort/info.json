    "advantages": [
        "Can achieve O(n) time complexity for certain datasets, making it very efficient for sorting large numbers of integers or strings.",
        "Does not rely on comparisons, which allows it to sort data that is not necessarily comparable.",
        "Stable sorting algorithm, maintaining the relative order of equal elements.",

    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires additional memory for the counting arrays, leading to O(n + k) space complexity, where k is the range of the input values.",
