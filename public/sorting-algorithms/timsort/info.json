    "advantages": [
        "Hybrid sorting algorithm combining Merge Sort and Insertion Sort, providing the benefits of both.",
        "Stable sort: maintains the relative order of equal elements.",
        "Adaptive: performs well on partially sorted arrays, achieving O(n) complexity in best cases.",
        "Efficient for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(n log n) in average and worst cases.",
        "Minimizes the number of comparisons and moves, leading to better performance in practice compared to other O(n log n) algorithms."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Complex implementation compared to simpler algorithms like Insertion Sort or Selection Sort.",
        "Requires additional memory for the temporary array used in the merge step, which can be an issue for large datasets.",
        "The performance may degrade on highly random datasets compared to more specialized sorting algorithms.",
        "Not as widely understood or implemented as other sorting algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort."
