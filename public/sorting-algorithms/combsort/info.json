    "advantages": [
        "Improves upon Bubble Sort by using a gap sequence to compare elements, leading to fewer total swaps.",
        "More efficient than Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort for larger datasets, with an average time complexity of O(n log n).",
        "In-place sorting algorithm: requires only a small, constant amount of additional memory.",
        "Adaptive: performs better for partially sorted arrays compared to algorithms that don't adapt to data structure."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Still not as efficient as more advanced sorting algorithms like Quick Sort, Merge Sort, or Heap Sort for large datasets.",
        "The gap sequence can lead to performance issues in certain cases, particularly if the initial data is sorted in a specific manner.",
        "Not a stable sorting algorithm: it does not maintain the relative order of equal elements."
