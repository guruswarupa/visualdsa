    "advantages": [
        "Parallelizable: can be efficiently implemented on parallel architectures.",
        "Stable sorting algorithm when implemented carefully.",
        "Has a predictable performance with a time complexity of O(logÂ² n) in the best, average, and worst cases.",
        "Suitable for sorting large data sets, especially when used in parallel processing."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires additional space for the auxiliary array, making it less memory-efficient.",
        "Not adaptive: does not perform better on partially sorted data compared to fully unsorted data.",
        "Complex to implement compared to simpler algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort."
