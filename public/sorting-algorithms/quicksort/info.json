    "advantages": [
        "Very efficient for large datasets with an average-case time complexity of O(n log n).",
        "In-place sorting algorithm, requiring only a small amount of additional memory (O(log n) for recursion stack).",
        "Generally faster in practice compared to other O(n log n) algorithms like Merge Sort, especially for smaller datasets.",
        "Simple to implement with a straightforward partitioning process."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Worst-case time complexity of O(n^2) occurs when the pivot selection is poor (e.g., already sorted data).",
        "Not a stable sorting algorithm, which may affect the order of equal elements.",
        "Performance can degrade significantly on small datasets compared to algorithms like Insertion Sort.",
        "Recursive implementation can lead to stack overflow for very large datasets if not handled carefully."
