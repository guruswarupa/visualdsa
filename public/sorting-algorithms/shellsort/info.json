    "advantages": [
        "An improvement over simple sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort, providing better time complexity (O(n log n) in the best case).",
        "In-place sorting algorithm, requiring only a small, constant amount of additional memory (O(1)).",
        "Adaptive: performs well on partially sorted arrays and can be tuned with different gap sequences for better performance.",
        "Simple to understand and implement, making it a good choice for educational purposes."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Time complexity can vary significantly depending on the choice of gap sequence, making it difficult to predict performance in some cases.",
        "Not a stable sorting algorithm, which may affect the order of equal elements.",
        "Generally not as efficient as more advanced algorithms like Quick Sort or Merge Sort for larger datasets.",
        "Performance on large datasets can be inferior compared to more optimized algorithms."
