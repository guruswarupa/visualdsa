    "advantages": [
        "Extremely efficient for sorting integers or objects with a small range of key values, achieving O(n + k) time complexity.",
        "Stable sorting algorithm, preserving the relative order of equal elements.",
        "In-place sorting can be implemented, requiring minimal additional memory.",
        "Simple to implement and understand, making it a good choice for educational purposes.",
        "Well-suited for applications where the range of input values is known beforehand."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Not a comparison-based sorting algorithm, which limits its application to specific types of data (usually non-negative integers).",
        "Requires extra memory proportional to the range of input values, which can be impractical for large ranges.",
        "Inefficient for data with a large range of values but a small number of elements (e.g., sorting numbers between 1 and 1,000,000 when only a few elements are present).",
        "Cannot be used for sorting objects directly unless keys are extracted and counted."
