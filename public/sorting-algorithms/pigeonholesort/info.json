    "advantages": [
        "Simple to understand and implement, based on a straightforward conceptual model.",
        "Efficient for small ranges of input values, particularly when the number of items is close to the range of keys.",
        "Stable sort: maintains the relative order of equal elements.",
        "Works well with integers or objects with a known, limited range."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Inefficient for large datasets with wide ranges of values, leading to excessive memory usage.",
        "Time complexity is O(n + range), which can be inefficient if the range is significantly larger than the number of items.",
        "Not suitable for sorting data types that are not easily mapped to specific ranges (e.g., strings).",
        "Requires additional memory for the pigeonhole array, which can be a limitation for large datasets."
