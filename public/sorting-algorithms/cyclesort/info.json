    "advantages": [
        "In-place and non-comparison based sorting algorithm, requiring only O(n) additional space.",
        "Optimal for minimizing the number of writes: it performs the minimum number of writes to sort the array.",
        "Stable sorting algorithm: maintains the relative order of equal elements.",
        "Works well for small datasets and scenarios where minimizing writes is crucial, such as in EEPROM memory."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Complex to implement compared to simpler sorting algorithms like Insertion Sort or Bubble Sort.",
        "Inefficient for larger datasets with a time complexity of O(n^2) in average and worst cases.",
        "May have a higher constant factor in its time complexity, making it slower in practice for larger inputs."
