    "advantages": [
        "Improves upon standard merge sort by reducing the number of comparisons needed in the merge step, especially beneficial for larger datasets.",
        "Stable sorting algorithm, maintaining the relative order of equal elements.",
        "Suitable for external sorting and can handle large datasets efficiently."

    "disadvantages": [
        "More complex to implement compared to standard merge sort.",
        "Requires more memory than traditional merge sort due to the additional array for merging.",
        "Still retains O(n log n) time complexity, which may not outperform simpler algorithms on small datasets."
