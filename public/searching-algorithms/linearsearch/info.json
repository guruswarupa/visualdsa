    "advantages": [
        "Simple to implement and understand, making it a good educational tool.",
        "Does not require any additional memory for storage (in-place searching).",
        "Can be used on unsorted or unordered lists without any preprocessing."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Inefficient for large datasets with a worst-case time complexity of O(n).",
        "Not suitable for performance-critical applications compared to more efficient search algorithms like binary search.",
        "Requires scanning each element in the dataset, leading to potentially high execution times for large lists."
