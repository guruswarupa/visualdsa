    "advantages": [
        "Optimizes the search process by using additional information (like frequency counts) to speed up searches in sorted datasets.",
        "Can significantly reduce the number of comparisons in scenarios where certain elements appear more frequently.",
        "Works well for static datasets where the frequency distribution of elements is known in advance."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires additional memory to store frequency counts or other metadata, which can be a downside in memory-constrained environments.",
        "More complex to implement than standard binary search due to the need for pre-processing the dataset.",
        "Not suitable for dynamic datasets where element frequencies change frequently, as it would require constant updates."
