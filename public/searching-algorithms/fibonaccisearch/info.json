    "advantages": [
        "Also requires the dataset to be sorted and is based on Fibonacci numbers, which can provide a more efficient approach than binary search in some cases.",
        "Can be implemented using less memory than binary search due to its iterative nature.",
        "Better suited for systems where division operations are expensive, as it primarily uses additions."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "More complex to implement compared to binary search.",
        "Has a similar time complexity of O(log n) but can have higher constant factors, making it less efficient in practice for smaller datasets.",
        "Requires pre-computation of Fibonacci numbers, which can add overhead."
