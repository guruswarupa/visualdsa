    "advantages": [
        "More efficient than binary search in some scenarios, particularly for certain types of datasets where division into three parts yields better performance.",
        "Reduces the search space faster than binary search by dividing the dataset into three segments, potentially improving search time for large datasets.",
        "Can be more suitable for situations where comparisons are expensive since it makes fewer overall comparisons in some cases."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires the dataset to be sorted beforehand.",
        "More complex to implement compared to binary search due to the need to handle three segments.",
        "Generally, it has a similar worst-case time complexity of O(log n) as binary search but may have higher constant factors."
