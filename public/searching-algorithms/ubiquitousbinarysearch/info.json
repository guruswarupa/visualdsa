    "advantages": [
        "A widely applicable algorithm that can be used in various contexts beyond traditional searching, such as finding square roots or optimal values.",
        "Highly efficient for sorted datasets, with a time complexity of O(log n), making it suitable for large datasets.",
        "Can be adapted for different data structures and types of problems, including searching in matrices or for specific conditions."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires the dataset to be sorted beforehand, which can add overhead if sorting is needed.",
        "Less efficient for small datasets compared to linear search due to the overhead of logarithmic calculations.",
        "The implementation can become more complex when dealing with non-traditional datasets or multi-dimensional data."
