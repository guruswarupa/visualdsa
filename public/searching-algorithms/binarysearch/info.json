    "advantages": [
        "Much more efficient than linear search for large datasets, with a time complexity of O(log n).",
        "Can quickly locate an element in a sorted dataset, reducing the number of comparisons needed.",
        "Requires fewer iterations compared to linear search, making it suitable for performance-critical applications."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires the dataset to be sorted before the search, which can add overhead if sorting is needed.",
        "Not suitable for linked lists as it requires random access to elements.",
        "If the data is frequently changing, maintaining the sorted order can become complex and inefficient."
