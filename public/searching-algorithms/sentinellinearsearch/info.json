    "advantages": [
        "Improves the efficiency of linear search by eliminating the need for boundary checks, which can speed up searches in practice.",
        "Simple to implement and understand, making it a good educational tool.",
        "Effective for small datasets where linear search is already sufficient."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Still has a worst-case time complexity of O(n), making it inefficient for large datasets.",
        "The added sentinel can consume extra memory, which may be a consideration in memory-constrained environments.",
        "Not suitable for linked lists, as the concept of a sentinel is less effective without random access."
