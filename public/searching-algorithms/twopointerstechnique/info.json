{
    "advantages": [
        "Highly efficient for solving problems that involve pairs or subarrays, often achieving linear time complexity O(n).",
        "Can reduce the space complexity compared to other methods, as it typically uses a constant amount of extra space.",
        "Versatile and applicable to a wide range of problems, including sorting, merging, and finding pairs that satisfy certain conditions."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "May not be applicable to all types of problems, particularly those that do not involve sorted or sequential data.",
        "Can become complex for certain algorithms where the relationship between pointers is not straightforward.",
        "Requires careful implementation to ensure that pointers do not exceed array boundaries, especially in edge cases."
