    "advantages": [
        "Efficient for unbounded or infinite datasets, as it quickly finds the range in which the target may exist.",
        "Combines binary search with the ability to find the bounds of the search space, leading to a time complexity of O(log n) after the range is identified.",
        "Effective for sparse data structures, as it reduces the number of comparisons needed."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Requires the dataset to be sorted beforehand.",
        "Can be less efficient than binary search for small datasets due to the overhead of range finding.",
        "Not suitable for linked lists as it requires random access to elements."
