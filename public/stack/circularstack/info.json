    "advantages": [
        "Space efficiency: Circular stacks make better use of available space by reusing freed slots, which can prevent overflow in fixed-size implementations.",
        "Dynamic size: It can grow and shrink as needed while maintaining a continuous circular flow of data.",
        "Simplicity in implementation: The circular nature can simplify certain operations, such as wrapping around the end of the stack."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Complex implementation: Handling the wrap-around logic can complicate the stack's implementation and maintenance.",
        "Difficulty in understanding: The circular nature may be less intuitive for beginners compared to a linear stack.",
        "Potential for underutilization: If not managed well, some slots might remain unused, leading to wasted space."
