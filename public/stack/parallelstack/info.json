    "advantages": [
        "Concurrent operations: Multiple stacks can be processed simultaneously, enhancing performance in multithreaded applications.",
        "Resource utilization: Can effectively manage multiple data streams or tasks that can run independently.",
        "Flexibility: Allows for dynamic allocation of stacks based on the current demand of operations."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Complexity: Implementing and managing parallel stacks can be more complex than traditional stack implementations.",
        "Synchronization issues: Care must be taken to handle synchronization between stacks, which can lead to race conditions or deadlocks.",
        "Increased overhead: The need for managing multiple stacks may introduce overhead, affecting performance in simpler scenarios."
