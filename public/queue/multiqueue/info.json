    "advantages": [
        "Parallelism: Multiple queues allow simultaneous processing of different tasks, increasing throughput.",
        "Task segregation: Can be used to separate tasks into different queues based on their type or priority.",
        "Improved scalability: More queues allow for more parallel operations, improving the system's scalability."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Management complexity: Handling multiple queues requires careful monitoring and synchronization to prevent issues.",
        "Increased overhead: Maintaining multiple queues requires more resources, potentially slowing down the system.",
        "Uneven load: If tasks are not distributed evenly, some queues may become overloaded while others are underutilized."
