    "advantages": [
        "Easy to implement: A simple queue has a straightforward design, making it easy to understand and use.",
        "FIFO behavior: It enforces a natural first-in, first-out (FIFO) order, which is ideal for tasks like scheduling and data handling.",
        "Efficient for certain tasks: Ideal for buffering, queuing, and handling asynchronous tasks in a system."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Limited functionality: A simple queue only supports basic enqueue and dequeue operations, which may not meet the needs of more complex applications.",
        "Fixed size: In some implementations, the queue size can be fixed, which may lead to overflow if not properly managed.",
        "Slower for certain use cases: If implemented with arrays, the dequeue operation may require shifting elements, which can be inefficient in terms of time complexity."
