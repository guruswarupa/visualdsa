{
    "advantages": [
        "Versatile priority management: Allows both ends to have different priorities, useful in more complex scheduling algorithms.",
        "Efficient data retrieval: Provides fast access to both the highest and lowest priority elements.",
        "Supports complex applications: Ideal for applications requiring both increasing and decreasing priority order handling."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Complex implementation: The handling of both ends and priorities increases implementation difficulty.",
        "Higher memory usage: Requires additional memory to store both ends and maintain priority levels.",
        "Slower operations: Operations may not always be as fast as simpler queue structures due to the need for priority balancing."
