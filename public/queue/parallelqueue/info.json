    "advantages": [
        "Efficient priority management: Ensures that elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority.",
        "Optimized for certain algorithms: Perfect for applications like job scheduling, bandwidth management, and Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.",
        "Flexibility in task handling: Priorities allow for better handling of urgent tasks in complex systems."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Increased complexity: The priority sorting and maintenance make the queue more complex to implement.",
        "Slower than regular queues: Due to the need for priority maintenance, enqueue and dequeue operations can be slower.",
        "Potential for imbalance: If priorities are not managed carefully, the queue may become too focused on higher-priority elements, leading to starvation of lower-priority tasks."
