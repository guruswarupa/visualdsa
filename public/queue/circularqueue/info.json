    "advantages": [
        "Space-efficient: Reuses empty slots when elements are dequeued, avoiding overflow in fixed-size implementations.",
        "Constant time operations: Both enqueue and dequeue operations are O(1), making them efficient.",
        "Simple implementation: Reduces the need for complex memory management when dealing with queue overflow."

    "disadvantages": [
        "Complex implementation: Handling wrap-around logic and resizing in circular queues can complicate the implementation.",
        "Potential for underutilization: If elements are not dequeued efficiently, space may remain unused.",
        "Limited flexibility: The queue's fixed size can still lead to overflow if not managed carefully."
