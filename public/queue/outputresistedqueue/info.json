    "advantages": [
        "Simplified output management: Restricting only the dequeue operation reduces system complexity.",
        "Efficient enqueuing: Can handle inputs freely while controlling when output is allowed.",
        "Useful for specialized applications: Effective in scenarios where the system needs to control the timing of output."
    ],
    "disadvantages": [
        "Limited dequeue flexibility: Restricting output can cause the queue to become blocked or delay operations.",
        "Potential bottlenecks: If the dequeue operation is restricted too much, it may create a bottleneck in processing.",
        "Harder to manage: Managing restrictions on only the output side can add complexity to the systemâ€™s design."
